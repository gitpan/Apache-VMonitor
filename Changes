=head1 CHANGES (Apache::VMonitor)

=head1 ver 0.3 - Tue Oct 19 08:12:47 IST 1999 

* Added to top() section: date/time, uptime, average load, num of
  procs (linux only).

  Per process removed the memory segment info (wasn't interested),
  added instead a number of bytes transferred and a number of requests
  processed, a current status of each process, last request and the
  client's IP.

* Added a dynamic configuration: dynamically turn on and off all the
  sections and enter a verbose mode that explains each section and the
  used abreviations. and of course the explanations themselves :)

* Fixed the "bug" that displayed the processes that have been killed
  but wasn't yet replaced. (it doesn't display those anymore :)
